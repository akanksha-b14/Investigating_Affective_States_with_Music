Steps Explained : 
Source File Raw - Music_Emotion Survey Results
Hypothesis for each respective emotion class is constructed in a seperate tab. Include this in a tabular format in the deck. (1 slide) 
Each emotion class basic stats is derived and plotted as box plots. Include the snapshot and box plots in deck (either 1 or 2 or 4 slides). Refer to stats and boxplot folder
Step 4 purpose is to illustrate summary statistics and visualization.
As we are conducting One-way ANOVA and t-test on multiple means across time points within subjects, we check for the normality assumption for each emotional state. Refer to QQ plot folder.
For angry and fearful, the points lie on the reference line.
We also checked for outliers - refer to R-Code folder for interpretation
Conclude with t-test, generally the results were a mix of p<0.005 and p > 0.005. (I will need to research a bit on the interpretation of this conclusion)
